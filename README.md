# COMP SCI 101: Code Challenge and Discussion Board

Students will be asked to suggest solutions to fairly narrow questions:

+ Given a list of dictionaries [data structure code supplied here], what python statements will count the number of people with at least one pet

+ Given an array or list of values, write JavaScript or python code to calculate the standard deviation of the values: [LaTeX formula for standard deviation goes here] 

A student's participation grade will be a function of the number of code snippets (answers), questions (for clarification of the challenge), and comments (about code snippets) they post ...but, only if those posts are considered "substantive" by the teacher.

participation = (#snippets * X) + (#comments * Y) + (#questions * Z)


# User Stories

## Teacher 

### post coding challenges, moderate reponses

...and obtain a report of each student's participation

## Student

### search, question, answer, comment

...and see their participation score


#### Teacher: import a course roster

#### Teacher: determine grading scheme

A student's participation grade will be a function of the number of code snippets (answers), questions (for clarification of the challenge), and comments (about code snippets) they post ...but, only if those posts are considered "substantive" by the teacher.

participation = (#snippets * X) + (#comments * Y) + (#questions * Z)

can choose participation points for 

+ snippets (X points)
+ comments (Y points) 
+ questions (Z points)

#### Teacher: pose a challenge

+ post the challenge 
+ provide keywords to be used for convenience for later searches
	+ teacher can add keywords 
	+ (which will be saved for choosing again in future posts)
+ indicate which languages users will be limited to for responses
	+ teacher can add languages
	+ (which will be saved for choosing again in future posts)

#### Students: log in using their university email username

+ the username must appear on the instructor's roster

#### Student posts are anonymous (to other students)

+ student posts/comments will be anonymous 
  + (student names hidden from other students)
+ teacher's view will identify students on each code question/snippet/comment

#### Students: ask questions about the challenge

+ ask a question about the challenge 
+ view all other questions
+ edit their own question 
+ delete their own question

#### Teacher: clarify the coding challenge

+ The teacher will be pointed toward any unread questions
+ can edit the original challenge
+ that is, respond to users questions about the challenge

#### Students: answer a challenge

+ post a code snippet
+ indicate the language used

#### Students: comment on anyone's code snippet

+ post a comment about a specific code snippet
+ edit their own comments
+ delete their own comments

#### Students: edit their own snippet

+ but, required to comment (hopefully, explaining the change)

#### Students: delete their own snippet (if no comments attached)

+ cannot delete their own code snippets unless no comments have been posted

#### Teacher: respond/moderate student code snippets and comments

Well, the **Teaching Assistant** will probably moderate the student's posts!

The teacher will be pointed toward unread snippets and comments

+ comment on student code snippets to help clarify/correct
+ append to a student comment to help clarify/correct
+ delete a code snippet and its associated comments
+ delete a student comment on a code snippet
+ delete a student question about the original challenge
+ mark a student question, comment, or snippet as substantive (or not)
	+ substantive contributions count toward the participation grade
	+ either way, the item will no longer be marked "new" once moderated

#### Teachers and Students: search for snippets by keyword, language

+ see an index of all related snippets (posted by anyone)
+ click on a snippet to see more detail
  + view challenge description
  + view all comments

#### Teachers and Students: search for challenges by keyword, language

+ see an index of all relevant challenges 
+ click on a challenge to see more detail
  + view all related questions/snippets/comments

#### Students: view their own snippets

+ first view an index of all their snippets
+ then, can view individual snippet with a view as follows:
  + display the challenge
  + view the code snippet
  + view all comments associated with their snippet
    + teacher comments
    + student comments

#### Teacher: get a participation report

+ obtain a report of listing participation info for each student
  + counts of "subtantial" questions, snippets, comments
  + calculated participation score


#### Students: get a student-participation report

+ counts of (substantive) nippets, questions, and comments 
+ participation score based on the chosen grading scheme


#### Teacher: delete a posted challenge

+ likely this will be very rarely used, if ever

+ this deletes all student code snippets
+ this deletes all student comments/questions
+ teacher will be prompted to ask if they are absolutely sure of the delete
