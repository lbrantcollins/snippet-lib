# CMSC 101 Code Challenge and Discussion Board

Students will be asked to suggest solutions to fairly narrow questions:

+ Given a list of dictionaries [data structure code supplied here], what python statements will count the number of people with at least one pet

+ Given a list or array of values, write JavaScript or python code to calculate the standard deviation of the values: [LaTeX formula goes here] 

Their participation grade will be a function of the number of code snippets (answers), questions (clarification of the challenge), and comments (about code snippets) they post ...if those posts are considered "substantive" by the teacher.


# User Stories

## Teacher 

### post coding challenges, moderate reponses

...and obtain a report of each student's participation

#### pose a challenge

+ post the challenge 
+ provide keywords to be used for convenience for later searches
	+ teacher can add keywords 
	+ (which will be saved for re-use in future posts)
+ indicate which languages users will be limited to for responses
	+ teacher can add languages
	+ (which will be saved for re-use in future posts)

#### clarify the coding challenge

+ edit the original challenge
+ that is, respond to users questions about the challenge

#### delete a posted challenge

+ likely this will be very rarely used, if ever

+ this deletes all student code snippets
+ this deletes all student comments/questions
+ teacher will be prompted to ask if they are absolutely sure of the delete

#### respond/moderate student code snippets and comments

The teacher will be presented with options to view any unread snippets, questions, or comments (to speed up the moderation process).

+ comment on student code snippets to help clarify/correct
+ append to a student comment to help clarify/correct
+ delete a code snippet and its associated comments
+ delete a student comment on a code snippet
+ delete a student question about the original challenge
+ mark a student question, comment, or snippet as substantive (or not)
	+ substantive contributions count toward the participation grade
	+ either way, the item will no longer be marked "new" once moderated

#### import a course roster

#### get a student-participation report

+ counts of (substantive) nippets, questions, and comments 


## Student

### must log in using their university email username

+ the username must appear on the instructor's uploaded roster

### search, question, answer, comment

#### answer a challenge

+ post a code snippet
+ indicate the language used

#### edit posted snippet

+ edit their own posted code snippets (required to comment/explain)

#### edit posted snippet (if no comments attached)

+ cannot delete their own code snippets unless no comments 

#### ask questions about the challenge

+ ask a question about the challenge 
+ view all other questions
+ edit their own question 
+ delete their own question

#### comment on code snippets

+ post a comment about a specific code snippet
+ edit their own comments
+ delete their own comments

#### view their own snippets

+ first view an index of all their snippets
+ then, can view individual snippet with a view as follows:
  + display the challenge
  + view their own code snippet(s) for the challenge
  + view all comments associated with their snippet
    + teacher comments
    + student comments
    
## Teacher and students can search

### search by keyword(s) and/or language(s)

#### view snippets by keyword(s) and/or language(s)

+ see an index of all related snippets (posted by anyone)
+ click on a snippet and view details (including the challenge info) 

#### view challenges by keyword(s) and/or language(s)

+ see an index of all relevant challenges 
+ click on a challenge and view all questions/snippets/comments

## Use anonymous posting

+ student posts/comments will be anonymous 
  + (student names hidden from other students)
+ teacher's view will identify students on each code question/snippet/comment
